# Doers Minds
Doers Minds is a growing IT-driven team founded by Edward Villarin together with a group of close friends who share the same passion for technology. What began as casual friendship quickly transformed into a collaborative vision when we realized we were all pursuing careers in Information Technology and Computer Science.

From that shared foundation, we decided to build something meaningful — a team that turns ideas into solutions and passion into results. Since then, Doers Minds has steadily attracted clients through our dedication, technical expertise, and commitment to delivering high-quality work.

We take pride in being a group of problem solvers, creators, and innovators who aim to help individuals and businesses bring their projects to life.
